## About Prime Dragon
 Four students in Tokyo Tech created this game. It is very funny. However, sadly, this game is not sold in public. This game will be put in the B1 floor of Taki Plaza, so if you are a Tokyo Tech student, you can come to Taki Plaza and play this game. It is going to be put after summer vacation. If you do not have relation with Tokyo Institute of Technology, you cannot play this game. However, in university festival in 2022, Taki Plaza Gardener is going to hold board game cafe and this game can be played there!
